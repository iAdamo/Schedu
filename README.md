## About
![Untitled design (copy)](https://github.com/iAdamo/Schedu/assets/106432903/f6a42b5c-b3e6-4ab5-b6a8-f3999e73eea8)

This repository contains the source code for a web application called "SCHEDU" designed for school management.<br>

Schedu is a comprehensive web application designed for managing various aspects of a school, including user registration, student information, teacher management, and more.

The SCHEDU School Management System isn't just a portfolio project; it's a collective desire to revolutionize the way schools operate. As a team, we've felt the frustrations of data mismanagement, sky-high administrative costs, and the tediousness of tasks like slow registrations process and misplaced files. That's why we've come together with a shared vision: to create a solution that transforms the educational sector.

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
