## About
This repository contains the source code for a web application called "Schedu" designed for school management.<br>
Schedu is a comprehensive web application designed for managing various aspects of a school, including user registration, student information, teacher management, and more.

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
